    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Writes/Copies a file whose path is provided as flow variable to a location mounted in KNIME Explorer.
        The file to be copied must exist and be accessible. This node is mostly used in conjunction with file writers
        nodes, which are not able to write to the explorer directly (because of missing URL uploading or 
        missing path information), whereby the temporary location on the client to which the file is written to, 
        is determined using the "Create Temp Dir" node.
        </intro>
        <option name="File Path Variable">The variable that contains the absolute path to the input file or an URL.</option>
        <option name="Target Location">The URL of the KNIME Explorer location to write the file to.
        This value only represents a directory; the file name is derived from the source file.</option>
